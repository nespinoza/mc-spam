This directory will contain a library of functions useful for
exoplanet science. Its first tasks will be:

1) functions to predict radial velocity curves
2) a re-implementation of the Mandel & Agol formalism. 

It will also provide Perl/PDL and Python/Numpy interface to the library

For (1) the task is just implementing some formulas, nicely
summarized in Kane 2007. -- done

General guidelines:
(a) based on the GNU Scientific Library
(b) to be released under GSL eventually
(c) all functions have names starting with pl_ to avoid name clashes
